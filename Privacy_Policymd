# Fyllin Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 18, 2025**

## Overview

Fyllin is a Chrome extension designed to help users fill web forms using AI. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how the extension works.

## Data Collection

**Fyllin does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data to us.** We do not have servers that receive your information.

### What Fyllin Processes Locally

The following data is processed **entirely on your device** and is never sent to us:

- **Form Field Information**: When you use the autofill feature, Fyllin reads form field labels and attributes from the current webpage to understand what data is needed.
- **Uploaded Documents**: When you upload documents (PDF, images, text files) for extraction, all processing (including OCR) happens locally in your browser.

### What Fyllin Sends to Third-Party AI Providers

When you use the AI form filling feature, Fyllin sends the following to **your chosen AI provider** (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, or Groq):

- Form field labels and types (e.g., "First Name", "Email", "Phone")
- Document text (if using the "Fill from Document" feature)

**Important**: You must provide your own API key from these providers. Fyllin communicates directly with the AI provider's API using your key. We never see or have access to your API key or the data exchanged.

## Data Storage

Fyllin stores the following data locally in your browser using Chrome's secure storage:

- **API Key**: Your AI provider API key (stored securely in `chrome.storage.sync`)
- **Settings**: Your selected provider, model, and custom instructions

This data:
- Is stored only on your device(s)
- Syncs across your Chrome browsers if you're signed into Chrome
- Is never accessible to us or any third party
